# GIPHY-API

1. I have added all the features of the basic project and most of the features from the advanced project

2. The theme of my website is also animals. The pictures will appear still and they will turn to animation onClick. If the user clicks on
the animated image, it will become still.

3. Users have the option to add more animals. Every time a user clicks on a button, it will clear the page and bring 10 pictures from GIPHY-API.
However, there is a "Append more pictures button", that will allow users to add more picture at the bottom of the page.

4. There is a "My Favorites" area on the page. The background color for this section is yellow to distinguish. Users can click on the "Add to Favorite"
button and add a picture alongwith it's animation and rating in the "My Favorites" section.
